You need to create an .env configuration file for the bot to work properly. In the latter you will have to fill in three pieces of information:\n
1: TOKEN={your token}\n
2: CLIENT_ID={the client_id can be found on the Discord Developer Portal}\n
3: GUILD_ID={The guild_id can be found by activating the discord developer mode and right clicking on the server}
